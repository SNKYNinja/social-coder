i am building a cli tool that will help generate posts from template for daily coding challenge. I am building this cli using @clack/prompts. So can you start with helping me on how to setup the project so that its a robust cli tool that can be used easily by any type of user even if they arent much familiar with the terminal. Do not include any code related to the actual project for now. I want you to start with the setup first only

My project workflow

1. Users can set a custom template and save them too like for example a template named LinkedIn, or Twitter (users can name this template themselves)
2. Users can enter the cli to create a post:
(if there are no templates made prompt the user that no templates found, and continuing will use default template)
a. Set Day: default value should the incremented day of the last submission(if there are no prev submissions default it to 1)
b. Add problems (allow user to add as many problems they want): Title, Platform(leetcode, condingninja, codeforces, geeksforgeeks, codechef), Insights
c. Choose Template (list out the templates that the user has created, also include the default one)
d. Allow smooth interativity by having a back option for each command
e. After confirmation and preview paste the generated daily coding message to the clipboard
3. Allow users to browse there past posts
